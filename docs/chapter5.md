# Chapter 5: Choosing The Right ROM

After focusing on level editors and more, it is time to start with the ROM hacking part!

**The first task is to choose the game you want to hack!**

Obviously, it is your choice which game you want to hack, but as mentioned before, those games were released for different regions. If you create a new ROM hack, you probably want other people to play it. So before you start getting your ROM with a random region, it would be a good idea to take a look at [Romhacking.net/hacks](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks) to check which regions of your game are often used for ROM hacks. Other aspects like an existing disassembly or level editor could play an important role too!

This guide will focus on '**F-ZERO [E] [!].sfc**' first. Although there are not many F-ZERO hacks, this game is easy to hack and a good example for this guide.

# Chapter 1: Introduction

## Welcome to "The SNES ROM hacking guide"!

This guide will teach you how to create SNES / SFC ROM hacks on your own.

It features multiple chapters with different hacking categories and more.

**This guide is about creating Super Nintendo Entertainment System / Super Famicom ROM hacks! Some information may apply to other consoles too, but this guide will only focus on the SNES / SFC.**

This guide uses the short form SNES for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System AND the Super Famicom.
The process is the same for both consoles!

What are you waiting for... let's begin!

## What is a ROM (hack)?
If you read this guide, you probably know what a ROM and what a ROM hack is, but here is a short explanation anyways.
ROM is the short form for "Read Only Memory". This is simply the name for the storage chips you can find inside your Game Pak.

These chips contain the game itself.

**The ROM does NOT store your save games! This is done by the SRAM.**

The ROM files you have on your PC are ROM dumps, but they are often simply called ROM's too.

A ROM hack is a modified version of a original game ROM.
Those can change anything in the game like if you install a mod for a game on your PC!

**This guide will only teach you how to create ROM HACKS! You will not find many useful information about creating your own SNES games here.**

If you are fascinated by old games and you want to create your own ROM hacks, this guide should be the right one for you!

## Knowledge you should already have

Yes, this is an "easy understandable" guide, but that does not mean you can start right away!
Before you continue, you should ask yourself if you really want to learn more about this topic. The obvious answer would be yes, but ROM hacking will remain ROM hacking and this is NOT always easy. Even advanced people still struggle here and there. You have been warned!

Although this guide is meant to explain everything as uncomplicated as possible, you will not get around the assembly programming language (especially the 65c816 for the SNES) as well as some knowledge about binary and hexadecimal.

If you do not have any programming experience (assembly would be optimal), you should maybe learn the basics of programming and then come back here. Especially for the later parts, programming knowledge will become an essential part!

## Legal notice

**Downloading and publishing a ROM is illegal!**

If you need a ROM... well, Google is your best friend.
Please do not open an issue or write an e-mail in which you ask for a ROM file.

ROM hacks are being published as patches and those are legal cause you still need the original ROM!
A patch only contains the changes you made to the ROM, but this will be covered in a later chapter.

**This guide is NOT affiliated or approved by Nintendo!**

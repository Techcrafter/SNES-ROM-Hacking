# Chapter 2: Requirements And Setup

## Requirements

You do not need a lot of stuff to start creating your own SNES ROM hacks. You simply need a PC running Windows or Linux.

**If you use Linux, you must have the Wine compatibility layer for Windows applications installed!**

*Windows or Linux*

The screenshots in this guide were taken on Linux, but the process is the same on Windows.

**Mac OS with Wine compatibility layer installed was not tested! It may work, but there is no guarantee.**

## The Super Everdrive

This guide is not sponsored, but if you want to play your ROM hacks on a real Super Nintendo, you can use a Super Everdrive. It allows you to put your ROM hacks onto an SD-Card and play those on a real console to get the full experience, but this is fully optional. An emulator will work totally fine too!

## Setup

There is not much setup to do for now. We only need a SNES emulator and a nice tool called SNEStuff. While you read through the other chapters, you will encounter more tools you need to download, but an emulator and SNEStuff is all we need for now.

Here are some recommended emulators, but others will probably work fine too:

  * [Snes9x](https://www.zophar.net/snes/snes9x.html)
  * [bsnes](https://github.com/bsnes-emu/bsnes/releases)
  * [ZSNES](https://zsnes.com/index.php?page=files)

And [here you can download SNEStuff](https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=4613).

**Once you have installed an emulator and extracted SNEStuff, you are ready to continue with the next chapter!**
